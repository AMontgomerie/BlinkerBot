now:
- expand before mining out
- occasional bug for building proxy pylon
- there's still a bug in the expansion placement in some positions (horiztonl and maybe vertical)
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction
- some kind of infinite loop bug when i lost my natural?
- something weird happens with our base count at some point

later:
- attack locations needs to be a set of enemy bases, not just their main
- army only contains zealots and stalkers
- make executing build order items be handled in a generic way (currently doesnt support most researches or any units)
- improve building positioning (use pylons as central target locations rather than main base) & (use isPlacable in observation)
- continue implementing UnitData
- dont count broodlings or swarmhost boys as enemy army size
- chronoboost
- target micro
- stutter step / kiting

Hey, I'm having some trouble with 'ABILITY_ID::SMART'. I'm trying to get idle workers to be sent back to mining at the closest base, so I have 'bot.Actions()->UnitCommand(unit, ABILITY_ID::SMART, mineral);' where "mineral" is a pointer to the target mineral. It works fine for workers in the main base, but weirdly the command just doesn't do anything if the target minerals are outside my main. It works fine if I replace SMART with another command, e.g. a MOVE command to the target mineral instead. Is there something about SMART that I'm not understanding?
