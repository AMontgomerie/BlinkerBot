now:
- assignedMineralWorkers is not being updated correctly
- transfer probes
- expand before mining out
- occasional bug for building proxy pylon
- there's still a bug in the expansion placement in some positions (horiztonl and maybe vertical)
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction
- some kind of infinite loop bug when i lost my natural?
- something weird happens with our base count at some point

later:
- army only contains zealots and stalkers
- make executing build order items be handled in a generic way (currently doesnt support most researches or any units)
- improve building positioning (use pylons as central target locations rather than main base) & (use isPlacable in observation)
- continue implementing UnitData
- dont count broodlings or swarmhost boys as enemy army size
- chronoboost
- target micro
- stutter step / kiting
- build order generator
- productionManager is getting too large: refactor into baseManager, workerManager, productionManager
