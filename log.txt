high priority:
- change aggressive blink so it can be triggered by any stalker when attacking, also make stalkers actually target the unit they blunk
- more advanced dt: only run when visible and threats are in range
- still a 3 robo bug vs cloaked units
- blink into main vs fast expanders
- do a ffe
- pull workers vs drops
- make cannons vs banshee/oracle/voidray/muta
- defensive units need to have a shorter leash (defend ramp tops)
- prioritise chronoboosts on units in defensive situations (perhaps switch priority to trainUnits() over produce() too)
later:
- forcefield placement could work like storm?
- unfinished static defence counts as finished when we cant see it (causing retreats)
- remove destructible rocks from pylon placement
- make storms avoid friendly units more
- calculate lurker splash area
- try to wall the natural for more greedy openings
- check if structures are powered and set nextpylonlocation to nearby if not
- attack performance can maybe be increased  by widening the scope of the order check (before finding a target?)
- deal with idle workers at bases with no minerals
- reorganise methods to be consistent in each manager
- army splitting (dont pull everything back every time a scout comes in your base)
- implement more sophisticated DT control (avoid detectors and prioritise targets)
- deal with surrounds
- train only works for units that are trained from their own tech structure
- deactivate expensive methods based on framerate performance
- somehow deal with level2+ upgrades that require extra tech (perhaps a vector to show they require multiple?)
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- armysize updates are carried out on unit added/destroyed rather than recalculated completely
