necessary for ladder:
- checking for detection in production manager might be redundant due to train()'s ability to look up production requirements?
- sometimes not building an observer even when it's at the front of the queue

later:
- got a weird random number out of bounds error
- make a vector of key researches that generate build order goal can use
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps
- reduce kite blocking by checking stalkers that are closer to retreat point and moving those out of the way (maybe if they are out of range)
- continue implementing UnitData
- expand before mining out may or may not work (possibly working too fast and cutting our max worker count too)
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- fixed trying to fight creep tumour bug
- fixed a bug causing all workers to be pulled in response to a single worker harass
- restructured how rally point is stored so it can be moved more easily
- refactored for worker manager and fixed some worker bugs
- readded some stalker command spamming because they were occasionally running off in weird directions
