high priority:
- stop units from retreating ontop of a pylon rather than away from enemies
- movable structure bug
- fix the bug on LostAndFound
- fix infinite loop/crash bug
- race specific builds: need to deal with ling heavy armies
- reorganised methods and delete redundant or commented code
- fix lag caused by army manager

later:
- army splitting (dont pull everything back every time a scout comes in your base)
- built 3 robo facilities in response to banshees
- eventually go voidray
- aggressive blink under flying units
- improve cannon placement
- make train() able to switch between TRAIN and TRAINWARP
- implement more sophisticated DT control (avoid detectors and prioritise targets)
- remove duplicate tech structures
- deal with surrounds
- train only works for units that are trained from their own tech structure
- deactivate expensive methods based on framerate performance
- somehow deal with level2+ upgrades that require extra tech (perhaps a vector to show they require multiple?)
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps
- reduce kite blocking by checking stalkers that are closer to retreat point and moving those out of the way (maybe if they are out of range)
- continue implementing UnitData

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
