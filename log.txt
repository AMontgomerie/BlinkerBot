necessary for ladder:
- workers getting stuck on move command at minerals sometimes (possibly returnToMining but not sure)
- building pylons causes high latency frames

later:
- probes carrying gas get stuck unable to return to mining sometimes
- make a vector of key researches that generate build order goal can use
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps
- improve handling defend - doesn't always get triggered
- probably cant handle cannon rush
- reduce kite blocking by checking stalkers that are closer to retreat point and moving those out of the way (maybe if they are out of range)
- continue implementing UnitData
- expand before mining out may or may not work (possibly working too fast and cutting our max worker count too)
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction
- might be able to replace pylons in ProductionManager with observation()->getPowerSources()

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- factored in static defence to canAttack()
- prevented conga line suicides
- production manager tries to break deadlocks
- reduced some unnecessary spamming of actions by checking current unit orders before issuing another command
- fixed bugs preventing workers from being pulled
