high priority:
- defend against drops
	- better cannon placement
- ignore cloaked/burrowed units if we dont have nearby detection
- also ignore grenades and shit


when laddermanager works again:
- test that we can check for ling speed
- practice worker rush defence

later:
- remove destructible rocks from pylon placement
- make storms avoid friendly units more
- calculate lurker splash area
- try to wall the natural for more greedy openings
- check if structures are powered and set nextpylonlocation to nearby if not
- attack performance can maybe be increased  by widening the scope of the order check (before finding a target?)
- deal with idle workers at bases with no minerals
- reorganise methods to be consistent in each manager
- army splitting (dont pull everything back every time a scout comes in your base)
- improve cannon placement
- implement more sophisticated DT control (avoid detectors and prioritise targets)
- deal with surrounds
- train only works for units that are trained from their own tech structure
- deactivate expensive methods based on framerate performance
- somehow deal with level2+ upgrades that require extra tech (perhaps a vector to show they require multiple?)
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- units can now dodge aoe
- new units shouldnt rally all the way to forward pylon during a retreat
- ht can do feedback
- unit targeting ignores changelings, untargetables, and cloaked units
- improved cannon placement
