necessary for ladder:
- worker defence
- there's still a bug in the expansion placement in some positions (horiztonl and maybe vertical)

later:
- sometimes gets stuck making gateway units as they are higher priority than build order progress
- observer control
- search for enemy base when he hides it
- army only contains zealots and stalkers (and maybe colossus)
- continue implementing UnitData
- dont count broodlings or swarmhost boys as enemy army size
- target micro
- stutter step / kiting
- expand before mining out may or may not work (possibly working too fast and cutting our max worker count too)
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction
- might be able to replace pylons in ProductionManager with observation()->getPowerSources()

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
