necessary for ladder:
- workers getting stuck on move command sometimes
- handle fighting vs static defence
- building pylons causes high latency frames
- production manager causing lag when a nexus is building? (4th base)


later:
- make a vector of key researches that generate build order goal can use
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps
- improve handling defend - doesn't always get triggered
- probably cant handle cannon rush
- reduce kite blocking by checking stalkers that are closer to retreat point and moving those out of the way (maybe if they are out of range)
- continue implementing UnitData
- expand before mining out may or may not work (possibly working too fast and cutting our max worker count too)
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction
- might be able to replace pylons in ProductionManager with observation()->getPowerSources()

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- fixed framerate lag from worker defence
- improved performance of kiting
- reduced the frequency  of some calls in production and army to reduce lag
