necessary for ladder:
- need to come up with a new solution for proxy pylon
- worker defence
- there's still a bug in the expansion placement in some positions (horiztonl and maybe vertical)
- make production manager able to handle training units and researcing techs

later:
- sometimes gets stuck making gateway units as they are higher priority than build order progress
- observer control
- search for enemy base when he hides it
- army only contains zealots and stalkers
- make executing build order items be handled in a generic way (currently doesnt support most researches or any units)
- continue implementing UnitData
- dont count broodlings or swarmhost boys as enemy army size
- target micro
- stutter step / kiting
- expand before mining out may or may not work
- occasional bug for building proxy pylon
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- fix random so it doesnt always go bottom left
