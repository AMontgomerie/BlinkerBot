high priority:
- STILL A FUCKING CRASH WITH 0 PYLONS FFS
- dont warp in hts in defence mode
- dont defend forward pylon if its under attack
- new units shouldn't rally all the way to the forward pylon (or it should be interrupted if the army status changes)

when laddermanager works again:
- test that we can check for ling speed
- practice worker rush defence

later:
- sometimes stops producing workers despite extra bases
- check if structures are powered and set nextpylonlocation to nearby if not
- attack performance can maybe be increased  by widening the scope of the order check (before finding a target?)
- deal with idle workers at bases with no minerals
- reorganise methods to be consistent in each manager
- army splitting (dont pull everything back every time a scout comes in your base)
- aggressive blink under flying units
- improve cannon placement
- make train() able to switch between TRAIN and TRAINWARP
- implement more sophisticated DT control (avoid detectors and prioritise targets)
- deal with surrounds
- train only works for units that are trained from their own tech structure
- deactivate expensive methods based on framerate performance
- somehow deal with level2+ upgrades that require extra tech (perhaps a vector to show they require multiple?)
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps
- continue implementing UnitData

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
