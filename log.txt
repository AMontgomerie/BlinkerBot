necessary for ladder:
- improve building positioning (use pylons as central target locations rather than main base)
- worker defence
- there's still a bug in the expansion placement in some positions (horiztonl and maybe vertical)
- make production manager able to handle training units and researcing techs

later:
- observer control
- search for enemy base when he hides it
- trains too many probes (make max count dependant on mining bases)
- remove production manager's weird building switch statement thing
- army only contains zealots and stalkers
- make executing build order items be handled in a generic way (currently doesnt support most researches or any units)
- continue implementing UnitData
- dont count broodlings or swarmhost boys as enemy army size
- target micro
- stutter step / kiting
- expand before mining out may or may not work
- occasional bug for building proxy pylon
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- updated basemanager to reenter bases with visible minerals and gas once theyre completed
- production manager now calculates probe count based mining bases
- fixed snapshot bug for minerals and gas
- I think we fixed detection (check)
