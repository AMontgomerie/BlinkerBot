necessary for ladder:
- kiting seems to cause lag
- handle fighting vs static defence

later:
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps
- improve handling defend - doesn't always get triggered
- probably cant handle cannon rush
- reduce kite blocking by checking stalkers that are closer to retreat point and moving those out of the way (maybe if they are out of range)
- continue implementing UnitData
- expand before mining out may or may not work (possibly working too fast and cutting our max worker count too)
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction
- might be able to replace pylons in ProductionManager with observation()->getPowerSources()

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- added a probe scout for more than 2p maps
- adjusted proxy pylons for more than 2p maps
