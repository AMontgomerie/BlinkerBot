high priority:
- sortMineralLine only returns half of the minerals
- turned off the conga line preventer: need an alternative solution with less spazzing
- if a unit's dist to enemy is much closer than the avg, he should wait until the others catch up
- figure out the control flow of onStep in ArmyManager; it's a mess

later:
- check our erase methods
- somehow deal with level2+ upgrades that require extra tech (perhaps a vector to show they require multiple?)
- builds way too many pylons
- pylon occasionally unbuildable causing build order deadlock
- got a weird random number out of bounds error
- there's also a pointer/iterator issue with both a set and a vector
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps
- reduce kite blocking by checking stalkers that are closer to retreat point and moving those out of the way (maybe if they are out of range)
- continue implementing UnitData
- expand before mining out may or may not work (possibly working too fast and cutting our max worker count too)
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- improved expansion location calculation so bot no longer takes 3rd before natural on some maps
- improved scouting to include worker harass
- baseManager now removes unplaceable bases rather than getting stuck like a bitch
