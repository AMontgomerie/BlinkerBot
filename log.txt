necessary for ladder:
- sometimes not building an observer even when it's at the front of the queue
- defend against worker harass (responding to full army threat level rather than nearby)
- improve detection (blind make cannons?)
- workers getting stuck on move command at minerals sometimes (possibly returnToMining but not sure)

later:
- make a vector of key researches that generate build order goal can use
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps
- probably cant handle cannon rush
- reduce kite blocking by checking stalkers that are closer to retreat point and moving those out of the way (maybe if they are out of range)
- continue implementing UnitData
- expand before mining out may or may not work (possibly working too fast and cutting our max worker count too)
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction
- might be able to replace pylons in ProductionManager with observation()->getPowerSources()

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- enemy workers are now included in enemy army for defending worker harass purposes
- workers will now go home rather than chasing across the map
- fixed a crash bug when we have 0 pylons
