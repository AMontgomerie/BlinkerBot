high priority:
- when defending target closest enemy unit if possible (otherwise a move to target)

later:
- check if structures are powered and set nextpylonlocation to nearby if not
- attack performance can maybe be increased  by widening the scope of the order check (before finding a target?)
- deal with idle workers at bases with no minerals
- reorganise methods to be consistent in each manager
- army splitting (dont pull everything back every time a scout comes in your base)
- built 3 robo facilities in response to banshees
- eventually go voidray
- aggressive blink under flying units
- improve cannon placement
- make train() able to switch between TRAIN and TRAINWARP
- implement more sophisticated DT control (avoid detectors and prioritise targets)
- deal with surrounds
- train only works for units that are trained from their own tech structure
- deactivate expensive methods based on framerate performance
- somehow deal with level2+ upgrades that require extra tech (perhaps a vector to show they require multiple?)
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps
- continue implementing UnitData

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- fixed a bug causing duplicate structures to be made in some situations
- fixed a bug preventing units from kiting away from a rally point
- fixed a bug causing units to get stuck attack targeting a spore/spine that has been moved
- fixed a wall in placement bug on some maps
- fixed a bug causing an infinite loop when we have 0 bases
- race specific build orders (need tweaking?)
- reduced pointless stalker dancing
- fixed bug causing units to run all the way home before attack again
- stalkers now mass blink away when retreating and regrouping
- limited the number of techs that can be researched before expanding
- implemented storm
- implemented voidrays
- improved warpgate selection for production queue unit training
