high priority:
- some techs are not skipped correctly?

later:
- somehow deal with level2+ upgrades that require extra tech (perhaps a vector to show they require multiple?)
- builds way too many pylons
- pylon occasionally unbuildable causing build order deadlock
- improve scouting:
	- scout should be assigned (and replaced if dead)
	- scout can be triggered by not knowing the locations of any enemy bases, rather than game start
	- probe harass (attack, but if taking shield damage, run away until recharged)
- got a weird random number out of bounds error
- there's also a pointer/iterator issue with both a set and a vector
- make a vector of key researches that generate build order goal can use
	- if the tech is finished then remove it from the vector
	- while the tech is in production, exclude it from future build order goals and add the next one instead
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps
- reduce kite blocking by checking stalkers that are closer to retreat point and moving those out of the way (maybe if they are out of range)
- continue implementing UnitData
- expand before mining out may or may not work (possibly working too fast and cutting our max worker count too)
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- fixed a bug causing units to continue to defend a location after enemies had left
- created BuildOrderManager
- refactored generatebuildordergoal to be handled by buildordermanager
- BuildOrderManager also keeps track of keyTechs and completedTechs
