necessary for ladder:
- kiting seems to cause lag
- there's still a bug in the expansion placement in some positions (horiztonl and maybe vertical also both gas on the same side of minerals
- handle fighting vs static defence
- improve scouting for 4 player maps

later:
- improve handling defend - doesn't always get triggered
- probably cant handle cannon rush
- reduce kite blocking by checking stalkers that are closer to retreat point and moving those out of the way (maybe if they are out of range)
- sometimes gets stuck making gateway units as they are higher priority than build order progress
- search for enemy base when he hides it
- continue implementing UnitData
- expand before mining out may or may not work (possibly working too fast and cutting our max worker count too)
- bases might not be readded to available locations after a nexus destruction
- might be able to replace pylons in ProductionManager with observation()->getPowerSources()
