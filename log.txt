high priority:
- more advanced dt: only run when visible and threats are in range
- still a 3 robo bug vs cloaked units
- blink into main vs fast expanders
- do a ffe
- fix crash vs tyrz
- pull workers vs drops
- make cannons vs banshee/oracle/voidray/muta
- defensive units need to have a shorter leash (defend ramp tops)
- prioritise chronoboosts on units in defensive situations (perhaps switch priority to trainUnits() over produce() too)
later:
- unfinished static defence counts as finished when we cant see it (causing retreats)
- remove destructible rocks from pylon placement
- make storms avoid friendly units more
- calculate lurker splash area
- try to wall the natural for more greedy openings
- check if structures are powered and set nextpylonlocation to nearby if not
- attack performance can maybe be increased  by widening the scope of the order check (before finding a target?)
- deal with idle workers at bases with no minerals
- reorganise methods to be consistent in each manager
- army splitting (dont pull everything back every time a scout comes in your base)
- implement more sophisticated DT control (avoid detectors and prioritise targets)
- deal with surrounds
- train only works for units that are trained from their own tech structure
- deactivate expensive methods based on framerate performance
- somehow deal with level2+ upgrades that require extra tech (perhaps a vector to show they require multiple?)
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- static defence only counts towards enemy army when finished (kinda)
- aggressive blink can now be triggered during attack as well as defense
- aggressive blink prioritizes flyers
- units should only kite vs units that they can attack and that can attack them
- enemy army value only includes units that attack air if we have air units
- set a max regroup time so we can attack anyway
- reduced command spam from production manager
- fixed a bug causing a crash when dts have no targets to attack
- dts now avoid targets that are within detector range (only for static detection)
- build order manager now takes into account currently being researched techs
- implemented prismatic alignment for voidrays
- will now train voidrays vs terrans that are floating all their bases
