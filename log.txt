high priority:
- deal with surrounds
- figure out the control flow of onStep in ArmyManager; it's a mess

later:
- deactivate expensive methods based on framerate performance
- check our erase methods
- somehow deal with level2+ upgrades that require extra tech (perhaps a vector to show they require multiple?)
- builds way too many pylons
- pylon occasionally unbuildable causing build order deadlock
- got a weird random number out of bounds error
- there's also a pointer/iterator issue a vector
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps
- reduce kite blocking by checking stalkers that are closer to retreat point and moving those out of the way (maybe if they are out of range)
- continue implementing UnitData

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- fixed a bug causing crashes when no workers are available
- fixed readding base bug
- fixed a bug preventing reactions to worker harass
