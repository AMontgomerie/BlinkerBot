high priority:
- debug colossus blocking
- fix lag caused by army manager

later:
- use scout to hide a pylon on the map after enemy has units
- aggressive blink under flying units
- improve cannon placement
- make train() able to switch between TRAIN and TRAINWARP
- implement more sophisticated DT control (avoid detectors and prioritise targets)
- remove duplicate tech structures
- deal with surrounds
- train only works for units that are trained from their own tech structure
- deactivate expensive methods based on framerate performance
- check our erase methods
- somehow deal with level2+ upgrades that require extra tech (perhaps a vector to show they require multiple?)
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps
- reduce kite blocking by checking stalkers that are closer to retreat point and moving those out of the way (maybe if they are out of range)
- continue implementing UnitData

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- builds a dt when behind (and replaces it when it dies)
- improved handling of observers slightly
- fixed a bug with attacklogic and simplified control flow
- improved deadlock to re-randomize forward pylon
- dts and observers should continue to be rebuilt if the tech exists, regardless of game state
- some key units and structures are now blocking
- colossus are now trained separately
