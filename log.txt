high priority:
- switch PvZ build back to fast expand (second pylon in main, sentries afraid of lings, remove/update proxy pylon)
- implement warp prism
-ff
	- make a distinction between protect vs melee and cut vs ranged
- PvZ reactive unit compositions (colossus/storm vs hydra and voidray vs broodlord)
- change supply block detection to be a +% of our current supply
- rush defense being incorrectly triggered
- change aggressive blink so it can be triggered by any stalker when attacking, also make stalkers actually target the unit they blunk
- more advanced dt: only run when visible and threats are in range
- still a 3 robo bug vs cloaked units
- blink into main vs fast expanders
- pull workers vs drops
- make cannons vs banshee/oracle/voidray/muta
later:
- perhaps separate forge upgrades from key techs so that they arent delayed for so long
- improve build order execution by finding a worker close to the build location
- forcefield placement could work like storm?
- unfinished static defence counts as finished when we cant see it (causing retreats)
- remove destructible rocks from pylon placement
- make storms avoid friendly units more
- calculate lurker splash area
- try to wall the natural for more greedy openings
- check if structures are powered and set nextpylonlocation to nearby if not
- attack performance can maybe be increased  by widening the scope of the order check (before finding a target?)
- deal with idle workers at bases with no minerals
- reorganise methods to be consistent in each manager
- army splitting (dont pull everything back every time a scout comes in your base)
- implement more sophisticated DT control (avoid detectors and prioritise targets)
- deal with surrounds (do a distance checker like ling speed; if they haven't moved then blink them)
- train only works for units that are trained from their own tech structure
- deactivate expensive methods based on framerate performance
- somehow deal with level2+ upgrades that require extra tech (perhaps a vector to show they require multiple?)
- some weird behaviour around tanks and ramps

DONE FOR NEXT UPLOAD:
- FFE
- disabled forward pylon
- go zealot heavy vs lings
- emergency updates to production queue should no longer cause multiple buildings to be constructed
- forcefield implemented (defensive only)
- fixed a crash bug when we could only see enemy creep tumors
- implemented some double order detection but doesnt fully work
- temporarily switch PvZ to 4gate
